# milkylist // Work in Progress
Android App allowing users to have shared lists with friends, colleagues, etc.

The Idea of milkylist is a App (Android, other platforms will be following in the future), that allows users to create lists that
can be shared with and edited by other people. 

The user has to register/login (via email, facebook, google..) and can then add friends. After creating a new List, he is able to 
share the list with his friends. The creator of the list (admin) has the possibility to manage reading/writing rights of the other
users.
